# Leak report

The memory leak occured because the function strip allocates memory for the variable result during its execution. This memory is never deallocated at any point, resulting in the memory leak.

To fix the leak, we need to find where the last time the information stored in result is used, as if we deallocate the memory too early, then any parts that need to access that memory and the information in it later on won't be able to. If we examine the c file, we can see that the last time the memory in result is accessed is in the "is_clean" function. "is_clean" calls strip and stores that result in a variable called cleaned. So, the variable cleaned now points to the memory allocated. After "is_clean" compares the original string to the cleaned version, that memory is neved accesed again, so we can deallocate it. We can do this by adding a free(cleaned) statement after the comparison is made. However, we are not done yet. If we look at the strip function, that will occasionally return an empty string if the string it took as an argument was nothing but whitespaces. So, we must add an if statement before the free statement that checks to see if the cleaned variable is not equal to an empty string to ensure that there is actually memory allocated to it before we attempt to free anything.
